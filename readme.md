This app was designed off of an industry standard paper poster that showed a map of different telecom networks. I pitched this idea to management and got approval. Then wrote out concept and flow, pseudo code and scheduleâ€™s. I organized a team of content providers, writers, graphic design and testers over this 8 month project. 

Git doesn't keep the file structure that Xcode had so, it is in one big directory. Sorry about that. The main file you wil want to look over is ViewController.m, that is the brains of the whole operation.

This was started in 2010 and finished in 2011. It went through some changes with going to Xcode 4 and iOS 5.
