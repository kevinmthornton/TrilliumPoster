This app was designed off of an industry standard paper poster that showed a map of different telecom networks. I pitched this idea to management and got approval. Then wrote out concept and flow, pseudo code and scheduleâ€™s. I organized a team of content providers, writers, graphic design and testers over this 8 month project.
